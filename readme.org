* Arduino

This is a repository for playing around with an arduino, and in particular for trying out embedded rust development.

I've been following [[https://dev.to/creativcoder/how-to-run-rust-on-arduino-uno-40c0]] to get started.
* Notes
** Getting started
The error message
#+begin_example
error: failed to read `~/.local/rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/std/Cargo.toml`

Caused by:
  No such file or directory (os error 2)
#+end_example
can be fixed by running
#+begin_src shell
rustup component add rust-src
#+end_src
I spent quite a while on this since I thought I had =rust-src= already, but it was apparently out of date.

<2021-03-13 Sat> - A regression requires =nightly-2021-01-07=. Use
#+begin_src shell
rustup override set nightly-2021-01-07
rustup component add rust-src
#+end_src

** /dev/tty
To find the =/dev/tty*= id of the Arduino, run
#+begin_src shell
dmesg | grep tty
#+end_src
before and after plugging it in to see which entry is activated. It should say something like
#+begin_quote
[68307.027695] cdc_acm 1-6:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
#+end_quote

** Flashing
To flash the compiled program (built under =/target/avr-atmega328p/debug/=), run
#+begin_src shell
sudo avrdude -c arduino -v -p atmega328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -D -U flash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/debug/rust-arduino-blink.elf:e
#+end_src
